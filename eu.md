In machine learning, uncertainty arises in two different ways: Imperfect knowledge about the data-generating process ("Epistemic Uncertainty"), and irreducible noise in the data-generating process ("Aleatoric Uncertainty"). <br><br> In the classification setting, we use a function $$\mathcal{l}(\hat{\theta}, y)$$ to score the loss associated with the predicted probabilities for each class, $$\hat{\theta}$$, given the one-hot encoding of the true class, $$y$$. The aleatoric uncertainty can be defined as the expected loss under our predicted class probabilities which come from the learned model posterior $$Q$$\[1\]: 
$$AU(Q) = \mathbb{E}_{\hat{\theta} \sim Q}\mathbb{E}_{y \sim \hat{\theta}}[\mathcal{l}(\hat{\theta}, y)]$$
In words, aleatoric uncertainty quantifies the inherent uncertainty in the distribution over classes. For example, if we use the negative log-likelihood, $$\mathcal{l}(\hat{\theta}, y) = -\log(\hat{\theta}^Ty)$$, $$AU(Q)$$ is the expected entropy of $$\hat{\theta}$$.
